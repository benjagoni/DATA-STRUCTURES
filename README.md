# DATA-STRUCTURES
This repository is intended to share a variety of data structures with the methods required for their functionality. 
Some structures are implemented with nodes (the names finish with E or EE) while others are implemented using arrays (names usually end with an A). 
The binary trees are linked except for the MinHeap and MaxHeap that use an array. 
The ADT ending for the names of the classes is used for interfaces (which are included to some structures in the repository).
